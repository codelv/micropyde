import pyb

# USR button is controlled using a Switch object
# This is the one closer to the center of the pyboard
sw = pyb.Switch()
led = pyb.LED(4) # 4 is the blue LED

# toggles the LED when the USR button is released
# no need for while True: statement to keep this running
# read up on interrupts to understand how the below statement works
sw.callback(lambda:led.toggle())

'''
INTERRUPTS: 
to put it simply, when a function is registered with callback(), 
the microcontroller listens to a state change (low to high) on the USR button and registers this change. 
It then pauses any running code, executes the set function and resume code as usual

LAMBDA:
Python supports the creation of anonymous functions using lambda.
The above script could be rewritten to support user-defined functions as shown below.
Comment out the above script and uncomment the script below, and load it on your pyboard.
